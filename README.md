## General info
This program is designed to automatically create reports in xlsx format, based on the output of [awless](https://github.com/wallix/awless) program (**awless list**)

## Technologies
Program is created and tested with:
* Python version: 3.6 (3.6.3)

There are two versions of the program:
* awless.py
* awless_v2.py

**awless.py** program requires only one input â€“ aws profile name aka aws account.
   - **Pros:** one run for each account. Covers all regions.
   - **Cons:** execution time is much longer.

**awless_v2.py** program requires two inputs - region name and aws profile name (aka aws account) - and should be rerun each time for new region.
   - **Pros:** execution time is accordingly less.
   - **Cons:** multiple reruns per regions for each account.
